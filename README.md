Global App that will really be the decentralization of economy and the funding of proyects that will contribute to EveryONE.
Picture the stock market for example: Prices go up and down, people win or loose money according to the perceived value of a company, well not really. The market makers and the brokers always win: one thanks to the spread and the other because of the commission.
Of course there are market makers who actually loose money but let's not complicate the equation too much for now. 
By modifying the conditions of the spread and we grant the comission to the seller of the currency then ... everyONE wins.
By improving how: the increase of revenue affects the value of the currency, regardless of it's perceived value then... we get it again because if price goes up or down what always increases is the amount of circulation that is coming in and out of the system which is what creates real value, how useful something is.
This will in turn be a platform for a crowdfunding system that will benefit all by incorporating and financing through direct capitalization proyects for the benefit of all, such as renewable energy and many more.
